            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The Gaming Industry Visual Analysis website was developed for <strong>IAT 355 Introduction to Visual Analytics</strong> at SFU's 
                Interactive Arts and Technology program. The objective was to create a comprehensive guide to the Steam and PC gaming landscape in 2024, offering clear comparisons between AAA and indie games across various aspects such as number of game releases, average playtime, review scores, pricing, and more.</p>
            <p>By exploring the dataset, conducting in-depth research, and analyzing key industry trends, we transformed raw data into an accessible and engaging online resource. The website features a series of clear, data-driven graphs and interactive visualizations, enabling viewers to quickly grasp key insights at a glance while also allowing them to explore the dataset in detail to find the information most relevant to their interests.</p>

                <h2>Visualization Layout & UI Design Choices</h2>
                <img src="data/web_layout.jpg" alt="Flow Image 1">
                <p>To present complex gaming industry data in a clear and engaging way, the website was structured from the initial wireframes to the final layout with a strong emphasis on visual hierarchy. The landing section prominently displays the project's title and purpose to immediately capture attention, with all other elements kept minimal to preserve focus. </p>
                <img src="data/web_layout2.jpg" alt="User Flow Demo">
                <p>As users scroll, they encounter a gradual reveal of information—starting with high-level insights and moving toward more detailed breakdowns—allowing them to absorb content at their own pace. This approach reduces cognitive load and sparks curiosity, encouraging users to explore the dataset in depth.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Data Visualization Design</h2>
                <img src="data/gif1.gif" alt="Gif of interactive vis" />
                <p>The purpose of integrating interactive visualizations into the website was to make complex gaming industry data more approachable and engaging for users. Interactivity gives viewers the ability to explore patterns, compare metrics, and focus on data points most relevant to them, creating a sense of discovery rather than passive observation.</p>
                <img src="data/gif2.gif" alt="Gif of interactive vis" />
                <p>The visualizations were built using D3.js and Vega-Lite, chosen for their flexibility in creating responsive, data-driven graphics. Features such as hover effects and dynamic updates were implemented to reveal details on demand, allowing information to be presented progressively rather than overwhelming the user at once.</p>

                <p>This approach improves comprehension by reducing cognitive load, while keeping users engaged for longer periods. It also provides a more personalized experience, as viewers can control how they navigate and interpret the dataset, leading to deeper insight into the 2024 gaming industry.</p>

                <h2>Website Prototype</h2>
                <img src="data/web_proto.png" alt="Figma Prototype Flow">
                <p>We began by mapping the visualization placement and user flow in Figma, using placeholders to experiment with different arrangements. This allowed us to validate navigation paths and content order early on. Once the layout was set, the website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating Bootstrap for structure and custom CSS for detailed styling. Additional refinements were made to improve responsiveness, adjust layouts, and fine-tune interactivity.

                The result is a cohesive, functional platform that adapts across devices while maintaining visual clarity and a consistent design language, supporting both usability and engagement. </p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Working on this project strengthened my skills in creating interactive, data-driven experiences and deepened my understanding of how to present complex information in an accessible way. I became more proficient with D3.js, Vega-Lite, and JavaScript for interactive visualizations, as well as with Figma for planning layouts that anticipate user interaction.

            The project reinforced the importance of progressive information delivery and thoughtful visual hierarchy, both of which improve comprehension and user engagement. I also gained valuable experience balancing technical implementation with design considerations, ensuring that every feature served the purpose of making the dataset clear, engaging, and easy to explore.</p>
